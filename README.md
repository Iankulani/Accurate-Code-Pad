Accurate-Code-Pad is a lightweight, modern workspace for builders 
who switch between ideas fast. 
It launches in seconds, stays smooth on low-spec machines, 
and keeps you focused with a clean, red interface.

OpenAI configuration is built in: paste your API key, pick a model, 
set temperature, and toggle safe-mode prompts.
Draft, refactor, translate, or summarize code and documents without leaving the pad. 
Telegram configuration is also ready: connect a bot,choose channels, 
map commands to actions, and share outputs instantly.

The editor brings smart autocomplete, inline search, fenced code blocks, 
a monospace/markdown toggle, and a distraction-free Zen mode. 
Tabs stack neatly, files autosave, and crash-recovery restores 
your workspace exactly as you left it. 
Quick dashboards surface TODOs and commit notes, 
while keyboard shortcuts keep every action close to your fingertips.

Privacy matters: keys stay local unless you enable encrypted cloud sync. 
Themes include Dark, Sky, and High-Contrast for accessibility. 
Whether you’re shipping scripts, teaching, or reviewing PRs, 
Accurate-Code-Pad keeps your workflow fast, tidy, and shareable—one focused 
canvas for writing, automating, and collaborating. Built-in templates jumpstart docs, 
bots, and snippets, while extensions add linting and tests on save. 
Exports include TXT, JSON, and CSV, with shareable links for teammates and status badges.
